# Mura Training Docker Image

The [Mura Training Docker Image](https://hub.docker.com/r/digitalmine/mura-training) is specifically used for Official Mura Training.

## Docker Images

* [The "*Official*" Mura Docker Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/blueriver/mura/)
* [The "*Official*" Ortus Solutions CommandBox Container](https://hub.docker.com/r/ortussolutions/commandbox)

## Get Up & Running

[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) must installed and running on your computer (*Desktop Community* edition is perfectly fine) prior to following the steps below.

## After Docker Desktop Has Been Installed

Follow the steps outlined below to get the Mura training container up and running.

1. Clone the [Mura Training repository](https://github.com/digitalminellc/mura-training) to your desktop
2. Launch your shell program and `cd` into the cloned `../mura-training/` directory
3. Run the following command:

    ``` bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

    * Docker will then begin to do its thing. *The first time this is run, it will take awhile to finish.*

        ``` bash
        Creating network "mura-training_default" with the default driver
        Creating volume "mura-training_vol_muradb" with default driver
        Pulling svc_muradb (mysql:5.7)...
        5.7: Pulling from library/mysql
        f7e2b70d04ae: Pull complete
        etc ...
        ```

    * Once you see a notification about the `WEB CONTEXT`, the container should be ready and you may proceed to the next step.    

        ``` bash
        mura_1        | [INFO ] runwar.context: ===========================================
        mura_1        | WEB CONTEXT (8c069df52082beee3c95ca17836fb8e2)
        mura_1        | -------------------------------------------------------------------
        mura_1        | - config:/root/serverHome/WEB-INF/lucee-web (custom setting)
        mura_1        | - webroot:/app
        mura_1        | - hash:8c069df52082beee3c95ca17836fb8e2
        mura_1        | - label:8c069df52082beee3c95ca17836fb8e2
        mura_1        | ===================================================================
        ```

4. Once the container is ready, launch a browser window and navigate to [http://localhost:8008/](http://localhost:8008/).
5. If the site only contains an empty home page, navigate to [http://localhost:8008/?appreload&applydbupdates](http://localhost:8008/?appreload&applydbupdates) and the site should then be populated with sample content.

### Stop The Mura Training Container

To stop the container, follow the steps below.

1. Launch your shell program and `cd` into the cloned `../mura-training/` directory
2. Run the following command:

    ``` bash
    docker-compose down
    ```
